## Testing and Debugging

- **Testing**: The Password Generator application has undergone extensive testing to ensure its functionality. The following testing methods were employed:
  - **Unit Testing**: Individual components and functions were tested to verify that they work as expected. This includes testing password generation, slider value handling, and event listeners.
  - **Integration Testing**: The application's components were tested together to ensure that they interact seamlessly. This included verifying that the modal opens and closes correctly and that user options are processed accurately.
  - **User Testing**: The application was shared with real users to gather feedback and identify any issues they encountered. User feedback played a crucial role in refining the user interface and overall user experience.

- **Debugging**: During the development of the Password Generator, various debugging techniques were used to identify and resolve issues. This involved:
  - **Console Logging**: Strategically placed console.log statements were used to output information and identify the flow of the application, making it easier to pinpoint bugs.
  - **Browser Developer Tools**: The browser's developer tools, including the Console and Elements tabs, were instrumental in diagnosing and fixing issues. It allowed for real-time inspection of variables and HTML/CSS elements.
  - **Error Handling**: The application includes error handling code to gracefully handle unexpected user inputs and conditions. Error messages were provided to guide users when something goes wrong.

By implementing these testing and debugging strategies, the Password Generator aims to deliver a reliable and user-friendly experience.
